# PowerBI-Sales-Dashboard-Project
-> Project Overview
    This Power BI project focuses on building a dynamic and interactive Sales Analytics Dashboard using real-world, multi-country sales data. The objective was to analyze key business metrics such as revenue, customer distribution, and regional performance through a visually engaging and insightful dashboard. The project involved working with multiple datasets, including sales transactions, customer information, product details, and sales territories. These datasets were imported, cleaned, and transformed using Power Query Editor, followed by the creation of a well-structured data model with relationships and calculated measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
        ->Key features of the project include:
            Designing and implementing visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, KPIs, and slicers to make the data easy to interpret.
            Leveraging time intelligence functions to analyze trends over different periods.
            Enhancing interactivity through drill-downs, custom tooltips, and conditional formatting.
            Publishing the final dashboard to enable secure sharing with role-level security (RLS) for controlled access.

This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow—from raw data to decision-ready dashboards—and demonstrates practical skills in data transformation, modeling, visualization, and report publishing using Pow
